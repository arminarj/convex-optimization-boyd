# convex-optimization:

This is CVXPY implementation of convex optimization additional problems.

### notes:

- There is no guarantee for most of the solutions.


- This repo will be incomplete, but I'll try my best to implement some essential problom of every chapter of the book in Python.

- If you find any mistakes or find alternate solution or anything please send a pull request and help me to keep the list up to date.
